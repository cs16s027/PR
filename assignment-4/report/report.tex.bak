\subsection{HMM}
\textbf{Data} : Classes given to us are ``1", ``5" and ``z".\\
\textbf{Algorithm} : The data is divided into train (70\%) and test (30\%). The data is quantized using K-means with the number of symbols being equal to the number of means. A left-right HMM is trained on each class. Given a test datapoint, the likelihood of all three HMM-models on this datapoint are obtained. The predicted class is the one having the maximum likelihood.\\
\textbf{Experiments} : The number of states and the number of symbols are the free variables. Each state-symbol combination corresponds to one experiment. The ROC-DET curves are plotted for all these models.

\textbf{Observations} : The design of the codebook has a much greater impact on the performance than that of the states. $16$ is observed to be the optimal codebook size. Even a single state HMM, 16-symbols HMM performs better than HMMs with a smaller codebook. 

\subsection{DTW}

\caption{Each model is labelled by the number of nearest neighbours chosen.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Observations} : Near perfect classification is obtained using just a single neighbour. This suggests that DTW is a very good distance measure for time series data.

\subsection{HMMs versus DTW}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No training or hyperparameter tuning required in DTW.
	\item Unlike HMMs, DTW is memory and compute intensive during test time.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Connected Digits}
16-symbol, 10-state HMM models trained on each class are used for this task. The HMMs are then concatenated to form different continuous models. During concatenation the final state's self-transition probability is set to 0.5, and its next state transition probability is also set to 0.5. Sequence lengths upto 5 are considered. So there are a total of $ 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5 = 363$ HMM models against which each datapoint is tested.
