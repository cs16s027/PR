**Problem 2** : Polynomial Regression

20_1.txt : one-dimensional data
20_2.txt : two-dimensional data
20_3.txt : multi-dimensional data

TASK REQUIREMENTS : 
(a) Try different orders of the polynomials and try to find which best fits your given data.
(b) Perform Ridge Regression also on each of the 3 datasets. 
(c) NO inbuilt functions are allowed in this task. Code everything yourself.
(d) Plots showing the data and the approximated polynomial is required (Refer figures 1.2 to 1.7 of Bishop book)
(e) Plots showing the scatter plot i.e the target output vs the model output is required.
(f) Be creative in comparing the model outcome (or the model itself) with the actual outcome.
(g) Extra credits for more experiments and observations.
